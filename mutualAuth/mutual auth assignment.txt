T1:
A a man in the middle can pretend to be the server to the client and the client to the server by sending them respectively its own public key. Now, when the client (P) sends over its password, it is encrypted with the incorrect public key. This means that the man in the middle can now decrypt the message and read the password, and create its own message with that password and forward it to the server.

T2:
Code: TestClient2
    TestServer2
it works because the third party cannot decrypt and re-encrypt the password + nonce message with its own public key before both halves are sent.

T3:
TestClient3
TestServer3
1) a and b exchange (key, nonce) -> nonce means that the verification process can't be repeated
2) a and b aes-encrypt (the other person's nonce + the password) using the shared password <- This adds an extra layer of security that makes it immune to MITM (as password itself is treated as a secret key. Note the encryption part of this step is optional)
3) a and b interlock exchange the above -> third party cannot block or switch the exchanges information
4) a and b verify the shared password -> if incorrect, they can't reconstruct the original password
5) a and b generate a random string to build a shared aes key -> so neither of them can 'spoil' the key
6) a and b exchange these strings, AES encrypted with the password and RSA-encrypted with each other's public keys -> Again, the aes encryption is optional.
7) a and b concatenate these strings into an aes key
8) Now all messages are encrypted using this aes key

T4:
TestClient4
TestServer4
without knowing the data one cannot generate a hash of the data
this guarantees the data was accurately transmitted

T5:
TestClient5
TestServer5
0) a and b know the necessary public keys, and will be encrypting with these
0) because i did not want to make a main class, the rsa key exchange remains in the code
1) a and b generate a random string to build a shared aes key -> so neither of them can 'spoil' the key
2) a and b exchange these strings
3) a and b sign their strings and exchange the signatures
4) a and b verify the strings to come from each other
5) a and b concatenate these strings into an aes key
6) speak

T6:
if there is no knowledge whatsoever, it is impossible to verify anyone or anything
what players want is the minimal knowledge for authenticating things
one solution is a trusted server or certificate provider
the client verifies the server and verifies themselves to the server
the server, as a proxy, verifies everything else

the code is implemented separately, but a helper class can be found here:
TestClient6
TestServer6
